/**
 * Drives a single poker hand end-to-end: blinds -> preflop betting -> flop ->
 * turn -> river -> showdown (or an earlier fold-out), against a set of
 * PokerAgent implementations. This is the missing "engine driver" layer --
 * GameState exposes every primitive (postBlinds, setFirstActor, takeTurn,
 * advanceRound, dealCommunityCard, checkFoldWin, resolveShowdown) but nothing
 * previously called them in the right order for a full hand.
 *
 * One HandRunner.playHand() call plays exactly one hand. Chip stacks persist
 * on the Player objects inside the GameState across calls, so a caller wanting
 * a full session calls playHand() repeatedly with a fresh seed each time --
 * that's the next layer up (a SessionRunner), not built here. Note that this
 * runner does NOT handle player elimination: a 0-stack player will still be
 * dealt in and will check/call for 0 next hand (Player.resetForNewHand()
 * clears allIn/folded every hand), but can never win a pot since
 * GameState.computeSidePots() only counts players with totalCommitted() > 0.
 * A SessionRunner needs to filter busted players out before calling this
 * again if elimination is desired.
